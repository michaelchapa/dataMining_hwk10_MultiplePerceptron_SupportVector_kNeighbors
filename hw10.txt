A)
For e2 of C',
object p is selected and the e2-neighborhood of p is checked if it contains at least MinPts objects. 
Since e1 of C has a smaller radius than e2 and is presumabely using the same object p, the objects in its smaller radius will be a subset of the e2 larger radius.

B)
CLIQUE -> finds dense cells in all sub-spaces.

Identify subspaces that contain clusters:
	Partition the data space into the grid-structure and find the number of points that lie inside each cell of the partition
	Identify the subspaces that contain clusters using the Apriori principle
Identify clusters:
	Determine dense units in all subspaces of interest.
	Determine connected dense units in all subspaces of interest. 
Generate minimal descriptions for the clusters:
	Determine maximal regions that cover a cluster of connected dense units for each cluster. 
	Determine minimal cover for each cluster.
